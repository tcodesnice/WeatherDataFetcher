# Weather Data Fetcher
Description
The Weather Data Fetcher is a Python program that allows you to retrieve daily aggregated weather data for a specific location and date using the OpenWeatherMap API. You can provide a city name or zip code, as well as a date in YYYY-MM-DD format, to obtain weather information for that location on the specified date.

The program also uses the Google Geocoding API to convert the user-provided location (city or zip code) into latitude and longitude coordinates, which are then used in the OpenWeatherMap API request.

Prerequisites
Before using this program, you will need the following:

OpenWeatherMap API Key: Obtain an API key from OpenWeatherMap by signing up on their website. Replace 'YOUR_OPENWEATHERMAP_API_KEY' in the code with your actual API key.

Google Geocoding API Key: You'll need an API key from Google Maps Platform for geocoding. Follow the instructions provided earlier in this document to obtain one. Replace 'YOUR_GEOCODING_API_KEY' in the code with your actual API key.

Python: The program is written in Python, so you'll need a Python interpreter installed on your system. You can download Python from Python's official website.

Python Requests Library: The program uses the requests library to make HTTP requests. If you don't already have it installed, you can install it using pip:

pip install requests
Usage
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.

Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the program is located.

Run the program using Python:

python3 weather.py
Follow the prompts to enter the location (city name or zip code) and the specific date for which you want to retrieve weather data.

The program will make the API request to OpenWeatherMap and display the weather data on the terminal.

Example
Here's an example of how to use the program:

Enter a city name or zip code: New York
Enter a specific date (YYYY-MM-DD): 2023-09-15

[Weather data for New York on 2023-09-15 will be displayed here]
